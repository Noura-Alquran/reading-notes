## Sending form data
* **Objective**: To understand what happens when form data is submitted, including getting a basic idea of how data is processed on the server.
* The HTML form on a web page is nothing more than a convenient user-friendly way to configure an HTTP request to send data to a server. This enables the user to provide information to be delivered in the HTTP request.
* The < form > element defines how the data will be sent. All of its attributes are designed to let you configure the request to be sent when a user hits a submit button. The two most important attributes are **action** and **method**.
* The **action attribute** defines where the data gets sent. Its value must be a valid relative or absolute URL. If this attribute isn't provided, the data will be sent to the URL of the page containing the form — the current page.
* When the < form > specified with no attributes, the < form > data is sent to the same page that the form is present on.
* he action value should be a file on the server that can handle the incoming data, including ensuring server-side validation. The server then responds, generally handling the data and loading the URL defined by the action attribute, causing a new page load (or a refresh of the existing page, if the action points to the same page).
* The **method attribute** defines how data is sent. The HTTP protocol provides several ways to perform a request; HTML form data can be transmitted via a number of different methods, the most common being the **GET method** and the **POST method**.
* An HTTP request consists of two parts: a header that contains a set of global metadata about the browser's capabilities, and a body that can contain information necessary for the server to process the specific request.
* The GET method is the method used by the browser to ask the server to send back a given resource: "Hey server, I want to get this resource." In this case, the browser sends an empty body. Because the body is empty, if a form is sent using this method the data sent to the server is appended to the URL.
* The **Content-Length header** indicates the size of the body, and the **Content-Type header** indicates the type of resource sent to the server. 
* **Notes** :
   + If you need to send a password (or any other sensitive piece of data), never use the GET method or you risk displaying it in the URL bar, which would be very insecure.
   + If you need to send a large amount of data, the POST method is preferred because some browsers limit the sizes of URLs. In addition, many servers limit the length of URLs they accept.
* The **enctype attribute** lets you specify the value of the **Content-Type** HTTP header included in the request generated when the form is submitted. This header is very important because it tells the server what kind of data is being sent. By default, its value is ***application/x-www-form-urlencoded***. In human terms, this means: "This is form data that has been encoded into URL parameters."
##### If you want to send files, you need to take three extra steps:
  1. Set the **method attribute** to **POST** because file content can't be put inside URL parameters.
  2. Set the value of **enctype** to **multipart/form-data** because the data will be split into multiple parts, one for each file plus one for the text data included in the form body (if text is also entered into the form).
  3. Include one or more **< input type="file" >** controls to allow your users to select the file(s) that will be uploaded.
* Each time you send data to a server, you need to consider **security**. HTML forms are by far the most common server attack vectors (places where attacks can occur). The problems never come from the HTML forms themselves — they come from how the server handles data.
