## That Time When Women Stopped Coding :
[That Time When Women Stopped Coding](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding)
* After reading this article, I learned that learning styles have changed since the 1980s which affected the ability of women to keep pace with learning and development in the field of computer science. The reason for this is that professors in universities have taken into account that their students grew up with computers and learned computer science from an early age. This  assumption  frustrated many girls who did not deal with computers when they were young.
In summary, teachers should teach  their students computer science starting from the basics taking into consideration  that they do not know anything about this important field. This will develop a better, clearer and  more comprehensive  understanding. We also should encourage  our children, males and females, to learn programming as they learn mathematics and other  basic subjects at school, so that they  can cope with the new  developments in this field and help them find new job opportunities when they  get  older.

## Employee breakdown of key technology companies:
[Diversity in Tech](https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/diversity-in-tech/)
* I think that this study is full of racism because it is completely wrong to build our studies on  person's color, race, or gender . What distinguishes a person is his personal skills and his participation in the development of his/her community regardless of his/her race, color or gender. To be a successful employee in a company  for example, you should  be a productive and innovative  team member who applies his/her  skills to develop the company and help it to be pioneer in its field.

## Why diversity matters to your tech company :
1. **Diverse teams are smarter and more creative** :
Diverse groups of people bring to organizations more and different ways of seeing a problem and, thus, faster/better ways of solving it.
2. **Diverse companies perform better**.
3. **Companies are losing out on great talent** : demonstrate biased hiring practices can significantly affect the ways in which candidates from underrepresented backgrounds are evaluated in the recruiting process. Many tech companies pride themselves on creating environments where "the best idea wins." By attracting diverse candidates and designing interviewing processes that ensure a level playing field, companies have a better chance of ensuring the best idea is at the table. 
4. **Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base** .
5. **By failing to involve particular communities in the process of creating of new technology, we as a society lose out on the benefits of those community membersâ€™ ideas**.
