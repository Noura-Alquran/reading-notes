## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team:
* Studies show that working in groups tends to innovate faster, see mistakes faster and find better solutions to problems. Studies also show that people who work in teams tend to have better results and report higher job satisfaction.
* ‘‘group norms’’:  Norms are the traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather.
* The researchers eventually concluded that what distinguished the ‘‘good’’ teams from the dysfunctional groups was how teammates treated one another. The right norms, in other words, could raise a group’s collective intelligence, whereas the wrong norms could hobble a team, even if, individually, all the members were exceptionally bright.
* **Aristotle Project**research on psychological safety pointed to particular norms that are vital to success. There were other behaviors that seemed important as well like making sure teams had clear goals and creating a culture of dependability. But Google’s data indicated that psychological safety, more than anything else, was critical to making a team work.

## Notes:
* **“Roy Fielding”** is who helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the Internet and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. 

* **http**:the first part tells the browser what protocol to use / the most important breakthroughs in the history of computing because it is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. It's the foundation of the web. it like GPS coordinates for knowledge and information.

* Every **URL** would have a **human readable** and a **machine readable** representation. When a machine GETs the resource, it will ask for the machine readable one. When a browser GETs a resource for a human, it will ask for the human readable one.

## SuperAgent :
* SuperAgent is light-weight progressive ajax API crafted for flexibility, readability, and a low learning curve after being frustrated with many of the existing request APIs. It also works with Node.js
* A request can be initiated by invoking the appropriate method on the request object, then calling .then() (or .end() or await) to send the request.
* In Node.js SuperAgent supports methods to configure HTTPS requests:

 + .ca(): Set the CA certificate(s) to trust
 + .cert(): Set the client certificate chain(s)
 + .key(): Set the client private key(s)
 + .pfx(): Set the client PFX or PKCS12 encoded private key and certificate chain
 + .disableTLSCerts(): Does not reject expired or invalid TLS certs. Sets internally rejectUnauthorized=true.
