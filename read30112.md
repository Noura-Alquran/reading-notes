## EJS PARTIALS:
* **EJS Partials** come in handy when you want to *reuse the same HTML across multiple views*. Think of partials as functions, they make large websites easier to maintain as you don’t have to go and change a piece of text in every page it appears in. Instead, you define that reusable bundle of code in a file and include it wherever you need it.
* Including a partial in EJS is quite straightforward. You use ***<%- include( PARTIAL_FILE ) %>*** where the partial file is relative to the template you use it in.The command **include** is telling Express to pull the contents of the named template and place it in place of this command.
* **Note**: The <%- %> tags allow us to output the unescaped content onto the page (notice the -). This is important when using the include() statement since you don’t want EJS to escape your HTML characters like ‘<’, ‘>’, etc…
* Common uses for partial templates include headers, footers, site menus, login boxes, alerts, and so on.
