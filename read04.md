## Intro + Scripts notes :

* JavaScript used to make websites more interactive( by accessing and modifying the content, Programing rules or instructions the browser can follow ,responding to what the user does) interesting, and user-friendly. 
> jQuery makes writing JavaScript a lot easier.



* A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal step-by-step.

* Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions.

* Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task programmatically.

* To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.
  - 1: DEFINE THE GOAL
  - 2: DESIGN THE SCRIPT (using flow chart to help )
  - 3: CODE EACH STEP

## Expressions + Operators notes :
* An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions.

* Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.
  - ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
    + Assign a value to a variable
  - ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
    + Perform basic math
  - STRING OPERATORS 
    + Combine two strings
  - COMPARISON OPERATORS
    + Compare two values and return true or false
  - LOGICAL OPERATORS
    + Combine expressions and return true or false .
