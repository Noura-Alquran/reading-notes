# Read: 03 - Flexbox and Templating Summary
## Javascript Templating Language and Engine— Mustache.js with Node and Express:
* **Javascript templating "HTML markup"** is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with Javascript by using a **JSON data source**. 
* **Mustache** is a *logic-less template syntax*. It can be used for HTML, config files, source code — anything. It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object.
## A Complete Guide to Flexbox
* The **Flexbox Layout** (Flexible Box) module aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic.

  + **main axis** the primary axis along which flex items are laid out. 
  + **main-start** , **main-end** – The flex items are placed within the container starting from main-start and going to main-end.
  + **main size** – A flex item’s width or height, whichever is in the main dimension, is the item’s main size. 
  + **cross axis** – The axis perpendicular to the main axis is called the cross axis. 
  + **cross-start** ,**cross-end** – Flex lines are filled with items and placed into the container starting on the cross-start side of the flex container and going toward the cross-end side.
  + **cross size** – The width or height of a flex item, whichever is in the cross dimension, is the item’s cross size. 
* **justify-content** property values:
 + flex-start: Items align to the left side of the container.
 + flex-end: Items align to the right side of the container.
 + center: Items align at the center of the container.
 + space-between: Items display with equal spacing between them.
 + space-around: Items display with equal spacing around them.
*  **align-items** property values:
 + flex-start: Items align to the top of the container.
 + flex-end: Items align to the bottom of the container.
 + center: Items align at the vertical center of the container.
 + baseline: Items display at the baseline of the container.
 + stretch: Items are stretched to fit the container.

* **flex-direction** property values:
 + row: Items are placed the same as the text direction.
 + row-reverse: Items are placed opposite to the text direction.
 + column: Items are placed top to bottom.
 + column-reverse: Items are placed bottom to top.
* Sometimes reversing the row or column order of a container is not enough. In these cases, we can apply **the order property** to individual items. By default, items have a value of 0, but we can use this property to also set it to a positive or negative integer value (-2, -1, 0, 1, 2).
* **flex-wrap** property values:
 + nowrap: Every item is fit to a single line.
 + wrap: Items wrap around to additional lines.
 + wrap-reverse: Items wrap around to additional lines in reverse.
