# Read: 14a - DB Normalization:

* **Database normalization** is a process used to organize a database into tables and columns. The idea is that a table should be about **a specific topic** and that only those columns which support that topic are included.
* **Reasons for normalization**: There are three main reasons to normalize a database. The first is to minimize duplicate data, the second is to minimize or avoid data modification issues, and the third is to simplify queries
* The process to do this is called **normalization**, and the various stages you can achieve are called the **normal forms**.
* There are three common forms of normalization: **1st**, **2nd**, and **3rd** normal form.The forms are ***progressive***, meaning that to qualify for 3rd normal form, a table must first satisfy the rules for 2nd normal form, and 2nd normal form must adhere to those for 1st normal form. 
  * **First Normal Form**: The information is stored in a relational table and each column contains atomic values, and there are not repeating groups of columns.
  * **Second Normal Form** : The table is in first normal form and all the columns depend on the tableâ€™s primary key.
  * **Third Normal Form **: The table is in second normal form and all of its columns are not transitively dependent on the primary key.
* the basic understandings of DB normalization always help you to know the relational concepts, a need for multiple tables in the database design structures and how to query multiple tables in a relational world.
