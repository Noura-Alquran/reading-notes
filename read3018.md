## What is SQL?
* ***SQL"Structured Query Language"*** is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database. And due to its simplicity, SQL databases provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications.
* There are many popular SQL databases including **SQLite**, **MySQL**, **Postgres**, **Oracle** and **Microsoft SQL Server**. All of them support the common SQL language standard, which is what this site will be teaching, but each implementation can differ in the additional features and storage types it supports.

* **A relational database** represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables. Each of the tables are similar to an Excel spreadsheet, with a fixed number of named columns (the attributes or properties of the table) and any number of rows of data.

* To retrieve data from a SQL database, we need to write **SELECT*** statements, which are often colloquially refered to as **queries**. A query in itself is just a statement which declares what data we are looking for, where to find it in the database, and optionally, how to transform it before it is returned.
  - ***Select query for a specific columns***
      SELECT column, another_column, …
      FROM mytable;

  - ***Select query for all columns***
      SELECT * 
      FROM mytable;

* In order to filter certain results from being returned, we need to use a WHERE clause in the query. The clause is applied to each row of data by checking specific column values to determine whether it should be included in the results or not.
  - ***Select query with constraints***
      SELECT column, another_column, …
      FROM mytable
      WHERE condition
      AND/OR another_condition
      AND/OR …;

* In addition to making the results more manageable to understand, writing clauses to constrain the set of rows returned also allows the query to run faster due to the reduction in unnecessary data being returned. 

* When writing WHERE clauses with columns containing text data, SQL supports a number of useful operators to do things like case-insensitive string comparison and wildcard pattern matching. **All strings must be quoted so that the query parser can distinguish words in the string from SQL keywords**.

* Most data in real databases are added in no particular column order. As a result, it can be difficult to read through and understand the results of a query as the size of a table increases to thousands or even millions rows.To help with this, SQL provides a way to sort your results by a given column in ascending or descending order using the ***ORDER BY*** clause.
  - ***Select query with ordered results***
     SELECT column, another_column, …
     FROM mytable
     WHERE condition(s)
     ORDER BY column ASC/DESC;
* Another clause which is commonly used with the **ORDER BY** clause are the **LIMIT** and **OFFSET** clauses, which are a useful optimization to indicate to the database the subset of the results you care about.The LIMIT will reduce the number of rows to return, and the optional OFFSET will specify where to begin counting the number rows from.
  - ***Select query with limited rows***
     SELECT column, another_column, …
     FROM mytable
     WHERE condition(s)
     ORDER BY column ASC/DESC
     LIMIT num_limit OFFSET num_offset;
* ***Database schema*** is what describes the structure of each table, and the datatypes that each column of the table can contain.
* When inserting data into a database, we need to use an **INSERT** statement, which declares which table to write into, the columns of data that we are filling, and one or more rows of data to insert. In general, each row of data you insert should contain values for every corresponding column in the table. You can insert multiple rows at a time by just listing them sequentially.
  - ***Insert statement with values for all columns***
     INSERT INTO mytable
     VALUES (value_or_expr, another_value_or_expr, …),
       (value_or_expr_2, another_value_or_expr_2, …),
       …;
* In some cases, if you have incomplete data and the table contains columns that support default values, you can insert rows with only the columns of data you have by specifying them explicitly.
  - ***Insert statement with specific columns***
     INSERT INTO mytable
     (column, another_column, …)
      VALUES (value_or_expr, another_value_or_expr, …),
      (value_or_expr_2, another_value_or_expr_2, …),
      …;
* In these cases, the number of values need to match the number of columns specified. Despite this being a more verbose statement to write, inserting values this way has the benefit of being forward compatible. For example, if you add a new column to the table with a default value, no hardcoded INSERT statements will have to change as a result to accommodate that change.

* In addition, you can use mathematical and string expressions with the values that you are inserting.
This can be useful to ensure that all data inserted is formatted a certain way.
  -  ***Insert statement with expressions***
      INSERT INTO boxoffice
      (movie_id, rating, sales_in_millions)
     VALUES (1, 9.9, 283742034 / 1000000);

* "" ***Update statement with values***
UPDATE mytable
SET column = value_or_expr, 
    other_column = another_value_or_expr, 
    …
WHERE condition;
* The statement works by taking multiple column/value pairs, and applying those changes to each and every row that satisfies the constraint in the WHERE clause.""
* When you need to delete data from a table in the database, you can use a **DELETE** statement, which describes the table to act on, and the rows of the table to delete through the WHERE clause.
  - ***Delete statement with condition***
     DELETE FROM mytable
     WHERE condition;
* When you have new entities and relationships to store in your database, you can create a new database table using the CREATE TABLE statement.
  - ***Create table statement w/ optional table constraint and default value***
     CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS mytable (
     column DataType TableConstraint DEFAULT default_value,
    another_column DataType TableConstraint DEFAULT default_value,
    …
     );
* As your data changes over time, SQL provides a way for you to update your corresponding tables and database schemas by using the **ALTER TABLE** statement to add, remove, or modify columns and table constraints.
* In some rare cases, you may want to remove an entire table including all of its data and metadata, and to do so, you can use the **DROP TABLE** statement, which differs from the **DELETE** statement in that it also removes the table schema from the database entirely.
