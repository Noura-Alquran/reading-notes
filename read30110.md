# Read: 10 - The Call Stack and Debugging:
## Call stack "What It Is and Why It's Necessary ?"
* **A call stack** is a *mechanism* for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions â€” what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.So,It is a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).

  1. When a script calls a function, the interpreter adds it to the call stack and then starts carrying out the function.
  2. Any functions that are called by that function are added to the call stack further up, and run where their calls are reached.
  3. When the current function is finished, the interpreter takes it off the stack and resumes execution where it left off in the last code listing.

* If the stack takes up more space than it had assigned to it, it results in a **"stack overflow"** error.
* A **stack overflow** occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point. The browser (hosting environment) has a maximum stack call that it can accomodate before throwing a stack error.

* The call stack is primarily used for function invocation (call). Since the call stack is single, function(s) execution, is done, one at a time, from top to bottom. It means the call stack is **synchronous**.

## Types of error messages :
1. **Reference errors** : This is as simple as when you try to use a variable that is not yet declared you get this type os errors.
2. **Syntax errors**:This occurs when you have something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax, like when you try to parse an invalid object using JSON.parse.
3. **Range errors** 
4. **Type errors** : This types of errors show up when the types (number, string and so on) you are trying to use or access are incompatible, like accessing a property in an undefined type of variable.

## Debugging
  * The easiest and  most common way its to simply **console.log()** the variables you want to check or, by using chrome developer tools, open your page with your JS code (press cmd+o in macOS or Ctrl+o in Windows) and choose your file to debug, click the line you wanna debug and refresh your page again (F5).
  * If the line you selected was run you will be able to see what has happened before that point and you can try and evaluate the next lines to check if everything is outputting what you are expecting.

* when we do not handle errors properly, meaning that anything after that error will not be executed. To avoid this we usually try to catch the errors so we can gracefully fallback to a default state of our application in case of an error (this fallback can be a 404 page which is normally not that graceful but is better than a page to just stop working).
