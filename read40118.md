# Readings: Cryptography Summary
## Introduction to Cryptography
* **Cryptography** requires two steps: **encryption** and **decryption**. The encryption process uses a cipher in order to encrypt plaintext and turn it into ciphertext. Decryption, on the other hand, applies that same cipher to turn the ciphertext back into plaintext.

* * **Encryption**: scrambling the data according to a secret key (in this case, the alphabet shift).
* **Decryption** : recovering the original data from scrambled data by using the secret key.
* **Code cracking** : uncovering the original data without knowing the secret, by using a variety of clever techniques.

* **Types of Cryptography** :
1. **Hashing**  : Hashing is a type of cryptography that changes a message into an unreadable string of text for the purpose of verifying the messageâ€™s contents, not hiding the message itself.
2. **Symmetric Cryptography**:  This type of cryptography uses a single key to encrypt a message and then decrypt that message upon delivery.
3. **Asymmetric Cryptography** :Asymmetric cryptography (as the name suggests) uses two different keys for encryption and decryption, as opposed to the single key used in symmetric cryptography. The first key is a public key used to encrypt a message, and the second is a private key which is used to decrypt them.
4. **Key Exchange Algorithms** 

* **The 4 Types of Cryptographic Functions** :
1. Authentication
2. Nonrepudiation
3. Confidentiality 
4. **Integrity**: The most common way to do accomplish data integrity through cryptography is by using cryptographic hashes to safeguard information with a secure checksum.

## Ceasar Cipher :
* In cryptography, a **Caesar cipher**, also known as **Caesar's cipher**, the **shift cipher**, **Caesar's code** or **Caesar shift**, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

* The Caesar cipher can be easily broken even in a ciphertext-only scenario. Two situations can be considered:
  - an attacker knows (or guesses) that some sort of simple substitution cipher has been used, but not specifically that it is a Caesar scheme;
  - an attacker knows that a Caesar cipher is in use, but does not know the shift value.
