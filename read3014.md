# Read: 04 - Responsive Web Design and Regular Expressions Summary:
## CSS GRID
* The CSS Grid Layout Module offers a grid-based layout system, with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages without having to use floats and positioning.
* An HTML element becomes a grid container when its **display** property is set to **grid** or **inline-grid**.Grid containers consist of grid items, placed inside columns and rows.

* We define rows and columns on our grid with the **grid-template-columns** and **grid-template-rows** properties. These define grid tracks. A grid track is the space between any two lines on the grid. 
* The **grid-template-columns** property defines the number of columns in your grid layout, and it can define the width of each column.The value is a space-separated-list, where each value defines the width of the respective column.
* grid-template-columns grid-template-rows values < track-size > – can be a length, a percentage, or a fraction of the free space in the grid (using the fr unit) < line-name > – an arbitrary name of your choosing.
* Properties for the Children (Grid Items) **grid-column-start**, **grid-column-end**,**grid-row-start**, **grid-row-end**.

## Regular expressions 
* **Regular expressions** (regex or regexp) are extremely useful in extracting information from any text by searching for one or more matches of a specific search pattern .
* One of the most interesting features is that once you’ve learned the syntax, you can actually use this tool in (almost) all programming languages ​​(JavaScript, Java, VB, C #, C / C++, Python, Perl, Ruby, Delphi, R, Tcl, ..etc
